## OpenCV

OpenCV now supports a multitude of algorithms related to Computer Vision and Machine Learning and is expanding day by day.

OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages such as C++, Python, Java, etc., and is available on different platforms including Windows, Linux, OS X, Android, and iOS. Interfaces for high-speed GPU operations based on CUDA and OpenCL are also under active development.

## OpenCV-Python

OpenCV-Python is a Python wrapper for the original OpenCV C++ implementation.(since it is the actual C++ code working in background)

OpenCV-Python makes use of **Numpy**, which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations with a MATLAB-style syntax. All the OpenCV array structures are converted to and from Numpy arrays. This also makes it easier to integrate with other libraries that use Numpy such as SciPy and Matplotlib.
